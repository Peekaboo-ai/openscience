## Claude Science Customize (via AcademicForge)

`research/customize` is adapted and rewritten from Anthropic's Claude Science
Customize skill as hosted by [AcademicForge](https://github.com/HughYau/AcademicForge/tree/site-first/skills/claude-science/customize),
retrieved 2026-10-09. The upstream skill declares Apache-2.0 (independently of the
forge repository's MIT license). The OneLab adaptation replaces the Claude host
APIs with its permission-checked specialist tool and server-scoped persistence.
Author: Anthropic, as recorded in AcademicForge's ATTRIBUTIONS.md. Adaptation:
Synthetic Sciences. A copy of Apache-2.0 is included beside the adapted skill.

Most of the bundled skills under this directory began life in other open
collections. This file records where each one came from, under which license,
and how far it has been changed here, so the people who wrote them are credited
and the terms they chose are kept. Each skill's `SKILL.md` frontmatter carries
the same facts under `metadata.upstream*`; when a skill is added or re-synced,
update both. Skills not listed here were written for OpenScience by Synthetic
Sciences.

Relationship values: **derived** (the upstream text, edited for OpenScience's
tools and conventions), **adapted and rewritten** (the upstream skill is the
origin; the text is new), **references and scripts derived** (the `SKILL.md` is
OpenScience's; reference documents or scripts under the skill come from
upstream), **vendored** (unchanged apart from paths).
